# Electro Sounds - Final Frontier

A project by Ernest Foo using p5.js for Electro Sounds Semester 2

Project Description
---
Final Frontier is the result of a semester's worth of learning coding in p5js. The audio reactive piece features the use of 3D shapes and shaders to generate intriguing visuals that moves with the music. Through taking different values from the frequency spectrum, it responds to sound through either a mic or an internal application that will trigger its motion. You can expect jumpy visuals as shapes and colors pop out, with varying levels of distortion reacting to the sound you feed it. There are 4 different 'scenes' to play around with, controllable by the number keys '1' through '4' on your keyboard. The design borrows inspiration from a minimilistic culture as it defaults with simple and small objects that transfroms into a richness of colour and scale.

Reflection

Through this journey of creating a work of art within the span of a few weeks, i felt like i have amassed so much. As a total beginner in this field, the learning curve was to me extremely intense, which discouraged me at times but i know that the outcome at the end of the day would be worth all the pain and struggles. For starters, the Recode project was an uphill battle while being the most valuable amateur's practice one could have. Trying to get the code looking just like an image on the webpage drilled in me the fundamentals which would serve me well in the near future. As week 8 began and we had to solidfy our plans for the final project, i decided to go with shaders as i wanted to challenge myself. I spend the next few weeks after, wrestling with this decision as it was an immensely difficult concept to grasp. However, as time goes by and more sketches were made, the process got less confusing and terms were easier to understand. Now, i'm glad to say i'm proud of the final outcome and thankful for the journey.

4 different scenes govern the aesthetics of Final Frontier. Cycle through them with the number keys '1' through '4' on your keyboard while Final Frontier is running.

Do not forget to allow Mic access
